# Project Summary
MedBooking is a toy project I intent to develop for booking doctors online to minimize human interactions, to reduce the patients incovenience and labor costs to the medical clinics and hospitals. During COVID-19, there was huge line up and waiting time in  most of the clinics as they were running at the limied capacity.
I am using Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithm for automatic oline booking where Patient needs to register and input symptoms. The app will determine the maximum likelihood of the dieseas, will search the specialist and theire availability and schedule the visit accordingly.

This app has been developed using Python-Flask libraries for GUI and accessing datasets while plotly-dash has been used for data plotting. 

Built with with Python-Flask/SQLAlchemy/NLTK/spaCY


The app developemnt is still in the initial stage, I will develop it as I get time in the coming months.
